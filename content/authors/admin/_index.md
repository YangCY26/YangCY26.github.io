Chaoyu Yang is now a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering (MAE) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Before joining CUHK in 2023, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. Yuanjin Zhao’s group at the Wenzhou Institute, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). He received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2015 and 2020, respectively. His current research focuses on microfluidics for novel material production, nature-inspired engineering, droplet dynamics, wettability, and microrobots. His innovative work has resulted in several publications in scientific journals, including Nature Chemical Engineering, Small, Chemical Engineering Journal, Research, Lab on a Chip, Physics of Fluids, Applied Physics Letters, Materials Chemistry Frontiers, Engineered Regeneration, among others.
