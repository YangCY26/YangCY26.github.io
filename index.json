You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math.

However, the low throughput to the current microfluidics hinders their widespread use in further applications. Herein, we present a piezoelectric flow focusing (PFF) platform for rapid production of uniform double emulsions with tailorable sizes and morphologies. In this platform, the outer phase of the dispersed jet was subjected to a programmable piezoelectric signal and vibrated synchronously. Subsequently, the perturbation with specific frequency propagated along the jet surface and dominated the breakup processes. Finally, emulsion droplets with controllable size and morphology were then well achieved in controllable jetting regime with high throughput. More attractively, the platform enables preparing elaborate designs of more complex emulsions by easily modifying the channel topologies. We believe that this PFF platform opens an avenue for high-throughput generation of complex emulsions with controllable structures, and would be highly applicable in material science, energy applications, and environmental areas.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://yangcy26.github.io/project/example/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"This project aims to present a piezoelectric flow focusing (PFF) platform for rapid production of uniform double emulsions with tailorable sizes and morphologies.","tags":["Droplets"],"title":"Massive generation of tailored double emulsions","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"xxxxx.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"94a30f1d505970c6162ebce90d391ef0","permalink":"https://yangcy26.github.io/project/microfibers/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/microfibers/","section":"project","summary":"This project aims to create programmable microfibers *via* piezoelectric microfluidics for droplet/liquid manipulation.","tags":["Fibers"],"title":"Programmable microfibers for droplet/liquid manipulation","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chaoyu Yang","Wenzhao Li","Yuanjin Zhao*","Luoran Shang*"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"92563061cc37b2ac755d3b6d2c66f2df","permalink":"https://yangcy26.github.io/publication/diode_tube/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/diode_tube/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study, we present a flexible liquid-diode microtube designed specifically for directional liquid transport in closed spaces, achieved through microfluidics.
